# Common Moves in Podcasting

## The Comedy Podcast
I covered two comedy podcasts that I listen to regularly. They are both nonfiction, comedy podcasts.Two Dope Queens is a podcast hosted by Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson. This Week Had Me Like is a podcast from Caroline Goldfarb.Both shows feature celebrity (or celebrity adjacent) guests on the podcasts each week. Two Dope Queens opens more conversationally like a talk show and then introduces the guests, and This Week Had Me Like starts with the host talking, but she is part of the conversation with the special guests. This Week Had Me Like is a comedy podcast that analyzes strange things celebrities do on the internet. After listening to both shows regularly since last summer, the biggest thing the have in common is their ads for things like Squarespace and Blue Apron. (It's also interesting that podcasts are able to sell so many ads because listeners can fast forward through them.)

### Organization
#### Opening  
Two Dope Queens Opens with advertisements read out by the cast and then jumps to an excerpt from the episode that you are about to listen to with no context. For example, episode one, titled "Dad Bods" starts with a clip of the leads talking about dad bods which is presumably how the title of the episode was picked. The show then jumps to an introduction of Two Dope Queens podcast in general, and then goes to a description of the episode from the stars, Phoebe calls it a " little backstory" on the episode.  
Then, they introduce the comedian guests, and the topics that Phoebe and Jessica plan to cover. For episode one, they cover the itinerary of their comedic guests. The show features three guests and between their comedic acts, Jessica and Phoebe talk about what's happening in their everyday lives.   

#### Body of the Show
Before really getting in to the guests, Phoebe and Jessica start their first segment and basically talk as if they are catching up with their friends even though they are in front of a live audience. And basically tells stories about their regular life with a lot of detail, they laugh along and so does the audience.This is the first of many conversation breaks during the show. They introduce their first guest,Aparna Nancherla and she does a short routine. They break for ads read off by the stars and then jump back in to the program with Jessica and Phoebe again talking to each other with the audience listening on and laughing. They talk for a few minutes and then introduce the next comedian, Gary Goldman. After Gary, we hear more ads and the hosts chat a little more and introduce Michelle Buteau.

#### Closing the Show



#### _Common Organization Moves between Shows_
Both shows set up a set pattern in the first couple episodes and then tend to follow it pretty exactly. Sometimes they will talk about certain topics longer if they get really invested in the topic, (for example in two Dope Queens the taxi situation and the dad bods conversation got a lot of coverage), and in This Week Had Me Like sometimes the plebe vs expert conversation. Even though the shows have some set format, they still feel conversational.

Two Dope Queens' live audience makes it feel like more of a traditional comedy show, but some episodes of This Week Had Me Like are also live shows. So it seems like a common thing to do to add to the atmosphere because there are people reacting to the show.

### Style
Upbeat music to transition between the comedian guests and the hosts of the show.
Both shows don't rely on a lot of FX for the narrative. They don't really need them because they

#### _Common Narrative Types/Moves_

Both shows have different "things" that they both keep up with as part of the show for example on two dope queens: they speak in "abbreves" (abbreviations) and abbreviate things out loud like ubes i says YQY all the time (yass qween yass). "Are you guys ready for more show?"

Even if they don't always stay on topic, they maintain a regular order of conversation and features on both shows.
