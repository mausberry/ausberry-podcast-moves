# Common Moves in Podcasting

## The Comedy Podcast
I covered two comedy podcasts that I listen to regularly. They are both nonfiction, comedy podcasts._Two Dope Queens_ is a podcast hosted by Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson. _This Week Had Me Like_ is a podcast from Caroline Goldfarb.Both shows feature celebrity (or celebrity adjacent) guests on the podcasts each week. _Two Dope Queens_ opens more conversationally like a talk show and then introduces the guests, and _This Week Had Me Like_ starts with the host talking, but she is part of the conversation with the special guests. _This Week Had Me Like_ is a comedy podcast that analyzes strange things celebrities do on the internet. After listening to both shows regularly since last summer, the biggest thing the have in common is their ads for things like Squarespace and Blue Apron. (It's also interesting that podcasts are able to sell so many ads even though listeners can fast forward through them.)

### Organization
#### Opening  
_Two Dope Queens_ Opens with advertisements read out by the cast and then jumps to an excerpt from the episode that you are about to listen to with no context. For example, episode one, titled "Dad Bods" starts with a clip of the leads talking about dad bods which is presumably how the title of the episode was picked. The show then jumps to an introduction of _Two Dope Queens_ podcast in general, and then goes to a description of the episode from the stars, Phoebe calls it a " little backstory" on the episode.  
Then, they introduce the comedian guests, and the topics that Phoebe and Jessica plan to cover. For episode one, they cover the itinerary of their comedic guests. The show features three guests and between their comedic acts, Jessica and Phoebe talk about what's happening in their everyday lives.   

#### Body of the Show
Before really getting in to the guests, Phoebe and Jessica start their first segment and basically talk as if they are catching up with their friends even though they are in front of a live audience. And basically tells stories about their regular life with a lot of detail, they laugh along and so does the audience.This is the first of many conversation breaks during the show. They introduce their first guest,Aparna Nancherla and she does a short routine. They break for ads read off by the stars and then jump back in to the program with Jessica and Phoebe again talking to each other with the audience listening on and laughing. They talk for a few minutes and then introduce the next comedian, Gary Goldman. After Gary, we hear more ads and the hosts chat a little more and introduce Michelle Buteau.

#### Closing the Show
The show closes with Jessica and Phoebe talking alone again, without the audience, like in the introduction. They react to the show ("it was cray cray") and they give their shoutouts and credit their producer and theme music creator. Then they tell everyone to subscribe and sign off, sometimes theirs a brief (a couple seconds) of an outtake. And of course, another ad (so many ads).

#### _This Week Had Me Like_ Opening
Caroline introduces the show and her guests. She has a pop culture "expert" and a "plebe". Sara Ramos (from the show Parenthood) is the expert because she went on a Mary Kate and Ashley cruise once. Caroline introduces writer and director Matt Spicer as the "plebe" because he doesn't know as much about celebrities. Starting in the next episode, Caroline quizzes the plebe with pop culture questions.

#### _This Week Had Me Like_ Body
The show's body has set topics. The show always starts with Hot Topics of the day including Bernie Madoff's life and Gwyneth Paltrow's recent magazine cover. The conversation is more meandering in the introductory episode, but in subsequent episodes they follow a format with regular segments ("Hot Topics", "Celebrity Endorsements", "Spotlight", and "This Week Had Me Like").

#### _This Week Had Me Like_ Closing
The show closes with Caroline recapping and saying her goodbyes and thanks you's for the episode we just heard. She also tells everyone to rate and subscribe.

#### _Common Organization Moves between Shows_
Both shows set up a set pattern in the first couple episodes and then tend to follow it pretty exactly. Sometimes they will talk about certain topics longer if they get really invested in the topic. For example, in _Two Dope Queens_ the taxi situation and the dad bods conversation got a lot of coverage. In _This Week Had Me Like_ sometimes the plebe vs expert conversation. Even though the shows have some set format, they still feel conversational.

_Two Dope Queens_ live audience makes it feel like more of a traditional comedy show, but some episodes of _This Week Had Me Like_are also live shows. So it seems like a common thing to do to add to the atmosphere because there are people reacting to the show.

Both shows start off their first episodes by having the host(s) describe themselves and the show. You get a description of what to expect every week before getting in to the show. The later shows start with an introduction with highlights.

Both shows name their episodes based on a memorable conversation in the show. ("Dad Bods" from _Two Dope Queens_, and "Evian Bottles and Johnny Depp's Teeth"). Since the conversations the people on the show have are planned, but not scripted so their is some spontaneity, so they don't know before they record what throw away lines they'll say or what will be most memorable.

### Style Moves

#### Musical Transitions
Both shows rely on short musical transitions to signal the next segment. _Two Dope Queens_ has set theme music from the first episode including a wordless intro theme. In later episodes, _This Week Had Me Like_, had its own theme song. And each segment, ("Hot Topics", "Celebrity Endorsements", "Spotlight") have intro themes. The musical transitions are upbeat and add fun to the show and lead in to the segments.

#### Background Music

Background music is not as prevalent in the examples from the comedy genre compared to the shows that are more dramatic. Soft background music is still part of the transitions. So, when a host is talking about the upcoming segment there is accompanying music.

#### Other FX

Neither show relies on a lot of FX besides music to add to the show. They don't need them since they are both comedic and round-table in style.

### Narrative Types  
Both shows feature a conversational narrative when conveying information. When the characters tell a story they are usually talking like they are talking to a friend. For example, when Jessica describes one of her experience with a potentially racist cab driver in the chat section of _Two Dope Queens_, she tells the story they way someone would tell a friend. She imitate the voices of all the other players and gets more worked up as the story goes along.

On _This Week Had Me Like_, Caroline reads news clippings of celebrity gossip and they react as it happens. They also comment on the story with their own experience/

Both shows have different gimmicks/sayings that they both keep up with as part of the show for example on _Two Dope Queens_, they speak in "abbreves" (abbreviations) and say things like "ubes" (Uber) i says YQY all the time (yass qween yass). Phoebe regularly asks the audience "Are you guys ready for more show?" before they stop the conversation and get to the guests. Caroline on _This Week Had Me Like_ gives context to what she's talking about by having guests follow along with visual aids (provided on the Instagram page). She also throws out terms like "d-list" and "c-list" often.

### Other Observations
 The shows are not a set length, and that is probably because some conversations go longer since the shows are not tightly timed and scripted. Sometimes the discussions don't stay on topics, which adds to the natural, conversational humor of the shows. Even though they can get off topic, each show tends to maintain a regular order of discussion.

Comparing two shows within the same genre, I noticed how different shows backed by a big studio are from shows that don't have the same backing. _Two Dope Queens_ was created by WNYC studios so a lot of their "moves" sound more determined in the first episode and it also features a ton of ads. _This Week Had Me Like_, on the other hand, does not have a big studio producing it and doesn't start featuring advertisements until later into the season and the regular theme transitions aren't as polished in the first episode.
